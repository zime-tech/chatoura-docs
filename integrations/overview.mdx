## How Integrations Work

1. **Connect** - Authenticate with the platform
2. **Configure** - Set up response settings
3. **Deploy** - Your agent starts responding
4. **Monitor** - Track all conversations in one place

## Unified Inbox

All messages from every channel appear in **Chat History**. You can:

- View message history across all channels
- See which channel each session came from
- Pause AI responses when needed
- Track leads regardless of source
