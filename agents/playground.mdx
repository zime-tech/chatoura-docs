The Playground is a testing environment where you can interact with your AI agent, evaluate responses, and fine-tune settings before going live.

## Accessing the Playground

1. Go to **Agents** > select your agent
2. Click **Playground** in the sidebar

## Testing Conversations

Type messages in the chat interface to test your agent:

```
User: What are your business hours?
Agent: We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM EST...
```

### What to Test

- **Accuracy** - Are answers factually correct based on training data?
- **Relevance** - Does the agent understand the question?
- **Completeness** - Are responses comprehensive but concise?
- **Tone** - Does it match your configured tone settings?
- **Edge cases** - How does it handle unclear or off-topic questions?

## Evaluating Responses

After each response, consider:

1. Is the information accurate?
2. Would a customer find this helpful?
3. Does it reflect your brand voice?
4. Are there gaps in knowledge?

## Improving Responses

If responses need improvement:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the issue">
    Is it a knowledge gap, tone issue, or misunderstanding?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update training data">
    Add Q&A pairs or documents to address gaps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust settings">
    Modify tone, language, or instructions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrain">
    Click **Retrain** to update the agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test again">
    Verify the improvement in Playground
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session Management

Each Playground session is independent. To start fresh:
- Click **New Session** to clear conversation history
- The agent won't remember previous test conversations

## Tips

- Test common customer questions first
- Try variations of the same question
- Test in the language your customers use
- Have team members test independently
- Document issues and improvements needed
