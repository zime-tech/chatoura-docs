AI agents are the core of Chatoura. Each agent is a chatbot trained on your specific business data, capable of answering customer questions across multiple channels.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a conversational AI assistant that:
- Understands your products, services, and processes
- Answers customer questions in natural language
- Operates 24/7 across web, social, and messaging platforms
- Learns from documents, websites, and Q&A pairs you provide

## Creating an Agent

Chatoura provides a streamlined wizard to create agents with knowledge in one flow:

### Option 1: Website URL (Recommended)

The fastest way to create an agent:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** and click **New AI Agent**
2. Enter your website URL
3. Click **Continue** - Chatoura automatically extracts:
   - Your logo and branding
   - Website pages and content
   - Business name and description
4. Review the extracted knowledge sources
5. Optionally add files or edit business info
6. Click **Create AI Agent**

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you don't have a website or prefer manual configuration:

1. Click **New AI Agent** from the Dashboard
2. Click **Set up manually by uploading documents or typing the business information**
3. Add knowledge using the three source panels:
   - **Website** - Enter a URL to fetch pages later
   - **Files** - Upload documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD) - max 5 files, 10MB each
   - **Business info** - Enter your business name and description
4. Click **Create AI Agent**

<Tip>
You need at least one knowledge source (website pages, files, or business info) to create an agent.
