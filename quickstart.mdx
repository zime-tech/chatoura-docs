## Prerequisites

You need a Chatoura account. [Sign up here](https://app.chatoura.com/signup) if you don't have one.

## Step 1: Start Agent Creation

1. Go to your [Dashboard](https://app.chatoura.com/dashboard)
2. Click **New AI Agent**

You'll see the agent creation wizard with two options:
- **Enter your website URL** - Recommended for fastest setup
- **Set up manually** - If you don't have a website or prefer to add content manually

## Step 2: Add Knowledge Sources

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Website URL (Recommended)">
    The fastest way to create an agent:

    1. Enter your website URL (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`)
    2. Click **Continue**
    3. Chatoura automatically extracts:
       - Your logo and branding
       - Website pages and content
       - Business information

    <Note>
    The extraction typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on your website size.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Setup">
    If you prefer to set up manually:

    1. Click **Set up manually by uploading documents or typing the business information**
    2. Add your knowledge sources using the accordion panels:
       - **Website** - Enter a URL to fetch pages
       - **Files** - Upload documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD)
       - **Business info** - Describe your business, products, and services
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Review and Customize

After extraction (or choosing manual setup), you'll see the review screen with three knowledge source sections:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Website">
    Review the extracted pages from your website. You can:
    - Select or deselect individual pages
    - See a preview of each page's content
    - Add a different website URL if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Files">
    Upload additional documents to train your agent:
    - PDF files (.pdf)
    - Word documents (.doc, .docx)
    - Text files (.txt)
    - Markdown files (.md)
    - Maximum 5 files, 10MB each
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business info">
    Add or edit your business details:
    - **Business name** - Your company or brand name
    - **What does your business do?** - Describe your products and services
    - **What do customers usually ask about?** - Common questions, pricing, policies, hours, etc.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
