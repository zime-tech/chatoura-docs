Credits are the currency for AI responses in Chatoura. Each credit equals one AI-generated response.

## How Credits Work

- **1 credit = 1 AI response** sent to a customer
- Credits are deducted per response, not per conversation
- Incoming messages from customers don't use credits
- System messages (greetings, away messages) don't use credits

## Credit Usage Examples

| Action | Credits Used |
|--------|--------------|
| Customer asks a question | 0 |
| AI responds to question | 1 |
| Customer sends follow-up | 0 |
| AI responds to follow-up | 1 |
| System sends greeting | 0 |

## Checking Your Balance

View your credit balance in the dashboard header, which shows your current credits and usage.

## Monthly Credits

Each plan includes a monthly credit allowance:

| Plan | Monthly Credits |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | 50 |
| Starter | 1,500 |
| Pro | 6,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

### Refresh Cycle

- Credits refresh on your billing date
- Unused credits don't roll over
- Balance resets to your plan's allocation

## Need More Credits?

If you need additional credits beyond your plan allocation:

1. Contact the sales team
2. Discuss your usage requirements
3. Get a custom credit package

<Note>
Contact sales at [cal.com/islamibrahim/chatoura](https://cal.com/islamibrahim/chatoura) to discuss additional credits or custom plans.
</Note>

## When Credits Run Out

If your credit balance reaches zero:

1. AI stops responding to new messages
2. Messages queue until credits are available
3. Credits refresh on your next billing date

<Warning>
Monitor your credit usage to avoid service interruption. Upgrade your plan or contact sales if you consistently run low.
</Warning>

## Estimating Usage

Calculate expected credit usage:

```
Monthly Credits Needed =
  Daily Conversations ×
  Avg AI Responses per Conversation ×
  30 days
```

### Example

- 50 conversations/day
- 4 AI responses per conversation average
- 50 × 4 × 30 = 6,000 credits/month

## Optimizing Credit Usage

### Reduce Unnecessary Responses

- Use lead forms instead of asking multiple questions
- Configure concise responses
- Set up Q&A for common questions

### Monitor Usage

- Check your credit balance regularly
- Identify high-usage agents
- Track usage patterns

### Scale Appropriately

- Upgrade plan if consistently running out
- Contact sales for custom volumes
