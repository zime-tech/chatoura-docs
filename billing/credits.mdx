Credits are the currency for AI responses in Chatoura. Each credit equals one AI-generated response.

## How Credits Work

- **1 credit = 1 AI response** sent to a customer
- Credits are deducted per response, not per conversation
- Incoming messages from customers don't use credits
- System messages (greetings, away messages) don't use credits

## Credit Usage Examples

| Action | Credits Used |
|--------|--------------|
| Customer asks a question | 0 |
| AI responds to question | 1 |
| Customer sends follow-up | 0 |
| AI responds to follow-up | 1 |
| You manually respond | 0 |
| System sends greeting | 0 |

## Checking Your Balance

View your credit balance:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**
2. See current credit balance
3. View usage history

Or check the credit indicator in the dashboard header.

## Monthly Credits

Each plan includes monthly credits:

| Plan | Monthly Credits |
|------|-----------------|
| Starter | 1,000 |
| Pro | 10,000 |
| Business | Custom |

### Refresh Cycle

- Credits refresh on your billing date
- Unused credits don't roll over
- Balance resets to plan allocation

4. Complete payment

| Pack | Credits | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| Small | 500 | Occasional spikes |
| Medium | 2,000 | Regular top-ups |
| Large | 5,000 | High volume |

<Note>
Purchased credits are added to your current balance and expire with your billing cycle.
</Note>

## Credit Alerts

Set up alerts to avoid running out:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**
2. Enable **Low Credit Alerts**
3. Set threshold (e.g., 100 credits)
4. Receive email when balance is low

## When Credits Run Out

If your credit balance reaches zero:

1. AI stops responding to new messages
2. Active conversations are paused
3. Messages queue until credits are added
4. You can still manually respond

<Warning>
Customers may experience delays when credits are depleted. Set up alerts to avoid this.

```

### Example

- 50 conversations/day
- 4 AI responses per conversation average
- 50 × 4 × 30 = 6,000 credits/month
