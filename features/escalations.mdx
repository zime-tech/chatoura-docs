Escalations ensure important conversations get human attention. Configure triggers, notifications, and workflows to never miss critical customer interactions.

## How Escalations Work

1. **Trigger** - Condition is met (keyword, request, sentiment)
2. **Notify** - You receive a notification
3. **AI continues** - Agent keeps responding normally
4. **Handle** - You can take over when ready

<Note>
The AI agent continues responding during escalation. You can optionally pause the session if you prefer to handle it manually.
</Note>

## Escalation Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Keyword detection | Specific words like "speak to human" |
| Negative sentiment | Frustrated or angry messages |
| Repeated questions | Customer asking same thing multiple times |
| Off-topic | Questions outside agent's knowledge |

### Manual Triggers

- Customer explicitly requests human
- AI suggests escalation in response
- You escalate from dashboard

## Configuring Escalations

1. Go to **Agents** > select agent > **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Escalation Settings**
3. Configure triggers and notifications
4. Save changes

### Trigger Keywords

```

### Sensitivity Settings

|---------|-------------|
| High | Escalate at first sign of frustration |
| Medium | Balance between AI and human handling |
