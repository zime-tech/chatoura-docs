Your AI agent automatically captures lead information during conversations. View, export, and manage all leads in one place.

## How Lead Capture Works

1. Visitor starts a conversation
2. AI collects contact information during chat
3. Lead is created in your dashboard
4. You can follow up or export for CRM

## Viewing Leads

Go to **Leads** in the sidebar to see:

- All captured leads
- Contact information (name, email, phone)
- Source channel (web, Facebook, Instagram)
- Capture date
- Conversation link

| Name | Visitor's name |
| Email | Email address |
| Phone | Phone number |
| Source | Channel where lead was captured |
