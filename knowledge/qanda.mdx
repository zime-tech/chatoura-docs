Q&A pairs let you define exact answers for specific questions. Use them to ensure accurate responses for common or critical queries.

## When to Use Q&A

- **Common questions** - Frequently asked questions with standard answers
- **Critical information** - Pricing, policies, contact details
- **Specific phrasing** - When you need exact wording
- **Corrections** - Override incorrect learned responses

1. Go to **Knowledge Base** > **Q&A**
2. Click **Add Q&A**
3. Enter the question
4. Enter the answer
5. Click **Save**
6. Click **Retrain** to update your agent

## Example Q&A Pairs

```

   We're closed on weekends and major holidays.

## Question Variations

The AI understands question variations, so you don't need to add every possible phrasing:

| Original Question | Also Matched |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "What are your hours?" | "When are you open?" |
| "Do you offer refunds?" | "Can I get my money back?" |
| "How do I contact support?" | "What's your support email?" |

<Note>
If a specific phrasing isn't being matched correctly, add it as a separate Q&A pair.
