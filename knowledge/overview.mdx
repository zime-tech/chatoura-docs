The knowledge base is the foundation of your AI agent's intelligence. It contains all the information your agent uses to answer questions.

## How Training Works

1. **Add sources** - Upload documents, enter URLs, or add Q&A pairs
2. **Processing** - Content is extracted and analyzed
3. **Training** - Agent learns from the processed content
4. **Ready** - Agent can now answer questions based on the knowledge

## Managing Sources

### View All Sources
Go to **Knowledge Base** to see all training sources with:
- Source type and name
- Character count
- Processing status
- Last updated date

### Remove Sources
1. Click the delete icon next to any source
2. Confirm removal
3. Click **Retrain** to update the agent

<Warning>
Removing a source means the agent will no longer have that information. Always retrain after removing sources.
</Warning>

## Retraining

After adding or removing sources, click **Retrain** to update your agent. Training typically takes 1-2 minutes depending on data volume.

## Character Limits

Each plan has a maximum character limit for training data:

| Plan | Character Limit |
|------|-----------------|
| Starter | 100,000 |
| Pro | 1,000,000 |
| Business | Custom |

Characters are counted across all sources combined.

## Best Practices

- **Quality over quantity** - Focus on accurate, relevant information
- **Keep updated** - Regularly refresh with new content
- **Be specific** - Include FAQs and common questions
- **Avoid duplication** - Remove redundant information
- **Test after training** - Verify new knowledge in Playground
